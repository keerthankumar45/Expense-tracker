## Business Rules Implemented

* Title must be at least 3 characters long
* Amount must be greater than zero
* Category must be one of: Food, Travel, Shopping, Other
* Maximum 10 expenses can be added per day
* Duplicate expenses (same title, amount, and date) are not allowed

---

## Error Handling

The APIs return structured error responses. Example:

```
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid category"
}
```

Appropriate HTTP status codes are used:

* 201 → Created
* 200 → Success
* 400 → Bad Request
* 404 → Not Found
* 500 → Server Error

---

## Testing

Test cases are written using Jest and Supertest.

They cover:

* All CRUD operations
* Validation scenarios
* Edge cases such as invalid IDs, duplicate entries, and daily limits
* Filtering, pagination, and total calculation

Run tests using:

```
npm test
```
